## File explorer

In this directory you'll find step-by-step the creation of the
"file explorer" example application.

Step 1 contains only the initial `package.json` for the module.

Go into `step-2/` and run

    node index

to see the first stage of the application.

Step 3 contains two files that demonstrate the difference between using
`console.log` and `process.stdout.write`. Run them as follows and pay
attention to whether a newline is inserted or not after the "Hello World"
text.

    node example-1
    node example-2

To run the remaining stages of the application, head to step 4-6 and run

    node index
