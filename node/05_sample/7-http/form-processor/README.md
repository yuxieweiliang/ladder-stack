# HTTP

## Form processor

This example will walk you through the creation of your first HTTP app
with user interaction.

Step 1 contains only the package.json with your code.

Step 2-6 contain the progression of the app. Go into each folder and
run the app like this:

    node server

and point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to see it in action.

Notably, in Step 4 there's an example that covers the `querystring` 
module. Run it as follows

    node qs-example
