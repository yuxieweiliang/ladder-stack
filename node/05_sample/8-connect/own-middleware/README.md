## Your own middleware

All the examples for this chapter require that you install the module
dependencies from NPM as follows:

    npm install

Then run this example with

    node server

and point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Try hitting the routes `/a` and `/b` to trigger the timeout middleware!
