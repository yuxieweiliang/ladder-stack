# Stack Traces

To run the first example execute

    node abc.js

You should get a stack trace printed in the console.

The second example is run with

    node abc-async.js

The third example shows the ineffectiveness of `try/catch` for async
errors. Execute it and you should get an uncaught exception

    node try-catch.js
