# CLI and FS APIs

## argv

The examples in this directory demonstrate how to access the CLI
arguments passed to a program.

Run them as follows:

    node example

and

    node example-2

The trick is that you can experiment suppling arguments to them how you
would access them as an array. The examples print the representation
of that array to the terminal.

Try

    node example-2 my arguments

and other variations!
