## Basic Auth

All the examples for this chapter require that you install the module
dependencies from NPM as follows:

    npm install

Then run this example with

    node server

and point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

You will get asked for username and password. Enter any random data,
and then look at the terminal again to authorize!
